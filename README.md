Sleep Disorder Analysis — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🧠 Overview:
This project explores lifestyle, demographic, and health-related factors that contribute to sleep disorders. Using Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the project uncovers meaningful patterns and insights that may help identify individuals at risk and understand the root causes of poor sleep quality.

🎯 Project Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to:
Analyze the relationship between health metrics (BMI, sleep duration, stress level, etc.) and sleep disorders
Understand which variables have the strongest influence on sleep problems
Visualize key patterns using statistical plots
Derive actionable insights based on data-driven evidence
This project demonstrates practical data analysis skills relevant to a Data Analyst or Data Scientist role.

❓ Problem Statements:
The analysis aims to answer questions such as:
Which demographic groups are more prone to sleep disorders?
Does stress level correlate with sleep problems?
How does BMI impact sleep quality?
Do lifestyle factors like physical activity influence sleep health?
What variables show strong correlation with sleep disorders?

📊 Dataset Description:
The dataset includes variables such as:
Age, Gender, BMI Category, Sleep Duration, Quality of Sleep, Physical Activity Level, Stress Level, Blood Pressure, Sleep Disorder (Target Variable)
The dataset allows analysis of relationships between lifestyle factors and sleep disorders.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Project Workflow:
1. Data Cleaning -
Checked datatypes, Handled missing values, Converted categorical variables where necessary

2. Exploratory Data Analysis -
Distribution plots, Correlation heatmaps, Boxplots, Relationship exploration between features

3. Insights Extraction -
Identified trends and patterns affecting sleep disorders

4. Conclusion -
Summarized data-driven findings

💡 Key Insights:
Higher stress levels are strongly associated with sleep disorders.
Individuals with overweight or obese BMI categories showed higher chances of sleep issues.
Sleep duration and quality of sleep were major indicators of sleep disorder presence.
Lower physical activity levels correlated with poorer sleep quality.
Blood pressure variations also showed patterns associated with sleep disorders.

📝 Conclusion:
This project highlights the importance of analyzing health and lifestyle factors to understand sleep-related problems. The findings suggest:
Stress management plays a crucial role in sleep health.
Maintaining a healthy BMI can reduce sleep disorder risk.
Consistent physical activity improves sleep quality.
The project showcases practical EDA skills and can be used as a strong portfolio addition for data analysis roles.
