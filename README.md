# 😴 Sleep Disorder Analysis using Python (EDA Project)

## 📌 Overview
This project explores lifestyle, demographic, and health-related factors linked to **sleep disorders**.  
Using Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the goal is to uncover how variables such as **stress level, BMI category, sleep duration, physical activity, and health indicators** influence sleep health.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze factors affecting sleep quality and sleep disorders.
- Understand correlations among stress, BMI, sleep duration, and physical activity.
- Visualize patterns using Python libraries.
- Identify insights that can help understand risk factors.

## 🗂 Dataset Information
The dataset includes:
- **Demographics** → Age, Gender, BMI Category  
- **Health Metrics** → Sleep Duration, Quality of Sleep, Stress Level, Heart Rate, BP  
- **Lifestyle** → Physical Activity Level  
- **Target Variable** → Sleep Disorder (Yes/No)
Rows: *Varies depending on dataset*  
Columns: *Typically around 10–12*

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
- 
## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

### 📌 Load Dataset
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv")
df.head()
```
💡 Key Insights
High stress levels strongly correlate with sleep disorders.
Overweight/Obese BMI groups show higher sleep disorder prevalence.
Low physical activity is associated with poor sleep health.
Sleep duration and sleep quality are major indicators of sleep disorder risk.

🏁 Conclusion
Sleep disorders are influenced by a combination of lifestyle and health factors.
Managing stress, maintaining a healthy BMI, and improving physical activity may reduce sleep-related problems.

📎 How to Use
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
jupyter notebook
```
